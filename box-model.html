                <p>11 &nbsp; Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am,
                    therewith to be content.</p>
                <p>12 &nbsp; I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: everywhere and in all things I am
                    instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</p>
