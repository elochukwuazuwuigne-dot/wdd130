            Hi there my name is Azuwuigne Kizito, I am currently enrolled in the WDD 130 course at PCC.
            I have a passion for web development and design, and I am excited to learn more about
            creating engaging and user-friendly websites.
            In my free time, I enjoy watching anime, reading tech blogs, and experimenting with new coding techniques,
            I also love playing football and video games.
            I am looking forward to connecting with fellow students and professionals in the field,
            and to sharing my journey as I continue to grow and develop my skills in web development.
            Thank you for visiting my page, and I hope you find it informative and enjoyable!
            Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project.
