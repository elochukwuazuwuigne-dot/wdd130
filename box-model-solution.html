                <p>11 &nbsp; Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am,
                    therewith to be content.</p>
                <p>12 &nbsp; I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: everywhere and in all things I am
                    instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</p>
                <p>13 &nbsp; I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.</p>

        <div class="answer">
            <p class="question">Content area</p>
            <p>The text inside the callout is the <strong>content</strong>.</p>

            <p class="question">Padding</p>
            <p>Padding is the space inside the box around the content. This callout has padding applied.</p>

            <p class="question">Border</p>
            <p>The border surrounds the padding and content. In this callout, we have a subtle 1px border.</p>

            <p class="question">Margin</p>
            <p>Margin is the space outside the box. The callout has a margin of 10px separating it from other elements.
